    "Problem Statement:" Ola, a leading ride-sharing platform, aims to proactively identify drivers who are at risk of attrition (churn). Driver churn
    impacts operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and recruitment costs. Given a historical dataset containing driver demographics,
    performance metrics, and employment history, the objective is to build a predictive model using ensemble learning techniques to forecast
    whether a driver is likely to churn.
    This model should be able to generalize well on unseen data and provide interpretable, actionable insights that can support Ola‚Äôs driver
    retention strategy.

    "Key Objectives:"

    "Predictive Modeling:"
    Classify whether a driver will churn (Churn = 1) or stay (Churn = 0) using historical features.
    Ensemble Learning Focus:
    Apply ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, etc.) to improve model accuracy and robustness.
    Business Impact:
    Enable early intervention strategies to retain high-risk drivers.
    Reduce churn rate and associated costs.
    Model Interpretability:
    Identify key drivers of churn (e.g., income, rating, city, age, etc.).
    Support HR and operational teams with explainable metrics.""")
